# Healthcare Claims Data Visualization

## Project Overview
The Healthcare Claims Data Visualization application is designed to assist users in visualizing healthcare claims data through interactive data processing and visualization. By allowing users to upload Excel files containing claims data, the application processes the data, categorizes the variables, and suggests relevant visualizations. Additionally, the application incorporates user feedback to improve the visualization suggestions over time.

## Installation
To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd healthcare-claims-data-visualization
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   If you have a `requirements.txt` (not provided in this prompt, but typically present), run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, ensure you have the following libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas plotly
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Once the application is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` (or the provided URL).

3. Upload an Excel file containing your healthcare claims data.

4. Follow the prompts to correct variable categorization, select visualizations, and provide feedback.

## Features
- **File Uploading**: Upload Excel files for processing.
- **Data Processing**: Automatically reads Excel files and converts them into DataFrames for analysis.
- **Variable Categorization**: Categorizes variables based on data types.
- **Visualization Suggestions**: Uses an AI agent to suggest visualizations based on variable categorization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates interactive charts (Bar Charts, Histograms, Time Series) using Plotly.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporates user feedback to improve AI suggestions over time.

## Dependencies
The application requires the following Python packages:

- `streamlit`: For building the web application interface
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `plotly`: For creating interactive visualizations

These dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file or can be installed directly using pip as mentioned in the installation section.
